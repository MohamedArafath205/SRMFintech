st.title("Credit Score Improvement Model")
st.write("""
Your credit score acts as a pivotal metric that can significantly impact your ability to access various opportunities and services. 
A robust credit score is more than just a number; it's a reflection of your financial responsibility and trustworthiness in the eyes of lenders, 
landlords, and even potential employers. A high credit score opens doors to favorable interest rates on loans, increased chances of loan approval, 
lower insurance premiums, and even better rental or employment prospects. Conversely, a low credit score can limit your financial options, leading 
to higher interest rates, restricted access to credit, and potential barriers to securing housing or employment. Therefore, understanding and actively 
managing your credit score is essential for navigating the complexities of today's financial landscape and achieving your long-term financial goals.
